            <h2>A dedicated Front-end Developer based in Lucknow, India ðŸš€</h2>
            <p>
              As a Junior Front-End Developer, I have a strong command of HTML,
              CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind, and SCSS. I create visually
              appealing, user-friendly websites that adapt seamlessly to
              different devices. Writing clean and efficient code, I build
              dynamic and engaging interfaces, staying updated with the latest
              tools and techniques in web development. Collaboration is integral
              to my approach, as I enjoy working with cross-functional teams to
              deliver exceptional web applications.
